# Todo Today

A simple To Do app that acts as a daily list. Add and check off today's items – tomorrow they disappear! Ok... well, they go into the _Archive_ for a day so you can re-add them easily to the next day's list. 

## In Progress

- [ ] Remove archived todos
- [ ] Refresh app when the clock strikes midnight (or thereabouts). If the app is left open, Todos should be archived when user comes back the next day.
- [ ] Keyboard control:
  - [ ] capture typing a todo immediately
  - [ ] navigate, edit, and check items off quickly by keyboard

## Setup

```sh
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Compile and Minify for Production

```sh
npm run build
```
